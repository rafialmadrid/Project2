# Project2

Management of laboratory samples and the associated analysis and reporting were time-consuming back in the day.  Manual processes often riddled with transcription errors. 
This gave some organizations impetus to streamline the collection of data and how it was reported. Custom in-house solutions were developed by a few individual laboratories, while some enterprising entities at the same time sought to develop a more commercial reporting solution in the form of special instrument-based systems.
Client/server tools had developed to the point of allowing processing of data anywhere on the network.
That is how this came to reality, laboratory information system (LIS) or laboratory management system (LMS) is a software-based solution with features that support a modern laboratory's operations. 

About this Project:

Based on this information and the current need for solutions to the high demand in the health care domain we decided to create our own application that allows to different HCPs(Health care providers) to have a control on the different patients they have with the different studies each have and the respective financial history of them.
HCPs can create new records for new patients, search for the database of existing patients and make changes to them accordingly.
This helps to make the complete process so much simpler so they can focus on taking care of the patient, while we take care of them.
